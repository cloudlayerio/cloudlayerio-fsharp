# CloudLayer.FSharp
CloudLayer API for easy access to our REST based API services using the F# language.

# Note
This repo is specifically for f#, if you are using c# you should use our c# library. We did this because we wanted to give f# developers first class support instead of wrapping a c# library.

# Examples and Documentation coming...
